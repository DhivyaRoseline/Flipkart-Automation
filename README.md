## Flipkart Website Test Automation (Java + Selenium)

This is one of my beginner-level automation projects using Java and Selenium WebDriver.  
The main purpose of this project was to learn how to open a website using Selenium, interact with the webpage elements (like closing popups and entering search inputs), and automate a basic user flow on an e-commerce platform like Flipkart.



## What the Script Does

- Launches the Chrome browser
- Opens [https://www.flipkart.com](https://www.flipkart.com)
- Waits for the login popup to appear and closes it
- Enters a product name into the search bar (e.g., "laptop")
- Submits the search
- Waits for results to load
- Closes the browser automatically



## Tools & Technologies Used

- Language: Java  
- Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver  
- Browser: Google Chrome  
- IDE: Eclipse  
- Driver:ChromeDriver  
- Build Tool:Not used (no Maven yet, pure basic setup)
